# Git commit message from diff

### 2024-Jul-26

**Objective:** Generate a concise, technical git commit message (max 80 chars) focusing on the rationale behind the changes, along with key modifications, based on a simulated developer discussion.
**Prompt:** Simulate a detailed technical discussion between three senior developers reviewing a code diff:
1. Dev 1 (Product Vision): Focuses on the underlying problem or goal driving these changes.
2. Dev 2 (Technical Solution): Examines how the implementation addresses the identified need.
3. Dev 3 (Quality & Integration): Considers the impact on system reliability, maintainability, and scalability.
Developers should:
* Prioritize discussing the motivation behind the changes
* Analyze how the modifications solve specific issues or improve the system
* Debate the effectiveness of the chosen approach
* Consider alternative solutions and why they weren't chosen
* Examine potential risks or challenges introduced by the changes
* Use technical language while keeping the discussion grounded in practical outcomes
* Reference specific parts of the code to support their arguments
**Expected Output:** **Discussion:** [Natural, technical conversation between Dev 1, 2, and 3, reflecting points above]
**Final Output:** Commit Message: [Single line, max 80 chars, focused on why the change was made, highly technical and terse]
Top Changes:
* [3-5 bullet points, each single line, describing what was changed, technical and terse]
**Instructions:**
* Await the diff before initiating the discussion.
* Respond with "READY" to receive the diff.
